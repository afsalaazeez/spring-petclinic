================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The method 'processFindForm' uses 'owner.getLastName()' in the 'findPaginatedForOwnersLastName' method, which might be susceptible to SQL injection if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use prepared statements with variable binding (parameterized queries) or properly escape/validate user input. Consider using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool such as Hibernate or JPA.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The method 'processFindForm' uses 'owner.getLastName()' in a web page generation context, which might be susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use encoding/escaping libraries to handle user input when displaying it in a web page. Consider using a web framework that automatically escapes user input, such as Thymeleaf in Spring Boot.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method 'processFindForm' does not validate the 'page' parameter. Attackers could provide a large 'page' number to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by forcing the application to retrieve a large amount of data.
Solution: Validate the 'page' parameter to ensure it is within an acceptable range.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'processFindForm' method exposes detailed error messages to the user, potentially revealing sensitive information about the application's internal workings.
Solution: Avoid exposing detailed error messages to the user. Instead, log the detailed error messages internally and show a generic error message to the user.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Null Last Name

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessFindFormWithNullLastName
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the processFindForm method when the last name of the owner is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Owner object with null last name and prepare a model object. 
  Act: Invoke the processFindForm method with the created Owner object and the model. 
  Assert: Check if the last name of the owner is set to an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the processFindForm method correctly sets the last name of the owner to an empty string when it is null. This is important to ensure that the search can return all records.

Scenario 2: Test for No Owners Found

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessFindFormWithNoOwnersFound
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the processFindForm method when no owners are found. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Owner object with a last name that does not exist in the database and prepare a model object. 
  Act: Invoke the processFindForm method with the created Owner object and the model. 
  Assert: Check if the BindingResult object contains a rejection for the "lastName" field.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the processFindForm method correctly handles the case when no owners are found. This is important to ensure that the user is informed about the unsuccessful search.

Scenario 3: Test for Single Owner Found

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessFindFormWithSingleOwnerFound
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the processFindForm method when a single owner is found. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Owner object with a last name that exists only once in the database and prepare a model object. 
  Act: Invoke the processFindForm method with the created Owner object and the model. 
  Assert: Check if the method returns a redirect string to the found owner's page.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the processFindForm method correctly handles the case when a single owner is found. This is important to ensure that the user is redirected to the found owner's page.

Scenario 4: Test for Multiple Owners Found

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessFindFormWithMultipleOwnersFound
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the processFindForm method when multiple owners are found. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Owner object with a last name that exists multiple times in the database and prepare a model object. 
  Act: Invoke the processFindForm method with the created Owner object and the model. 
  Assert: Check if the method returns a string representing the view with the paginated list of found owners.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the processFindForm method correctly handles the case when multiple owners are found. This is important to ensure that the user is shown a paginated list of the found owners.
