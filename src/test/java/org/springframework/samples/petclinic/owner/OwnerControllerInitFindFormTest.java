================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The code currently does not validate or sanitize URL inputs, which could lead to redirection attacks where users are unknowingly redirected to malicious websites.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize URL inputs to ensure they are safe. Spring Security has built-in features that can help with this.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: If the code throws an exception, it might expose sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Set up a global exception handler to catch exceptions and return user-friendly, non-revealing error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If SQL queries are constructed by concatenating user inputs, it could lead to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If user inputs are directly used in web page generation, it could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Always encode user inputs that are used in web page generation. Spring Security has built-in features that can help with this.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: If the application does not use anti-CSRF tokens, it could be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens in all forms. Spring Security has built-in features that can help with this.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Correct Return String
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitFindFormReturnString.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the initFindForm() method returns the correct string "owners/findOwners". 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method does not take any parameters or use any pre-set data.
    Act: Invoke the initFindForm() method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string against the expected string "owners/findOwners".
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the correct string is returned by the method. This is important as the returned string is used to map to a specific view in the application.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Return
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitFindFormNullReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the initFindForm() method does not return a null value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method does not take any parameters or use any pre-set data.
    Act: Invoke the initFindForm() method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method does not return a null value. This is important as a null return could potentially cause exceptions elsewhere in the application.

Scenario 3: Test for Unexpected Return
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitFindFormUnexpectedReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the initFindForm() method does not return an unexpected string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method does not take any parameters or use any pre-set data.
    Act: Invoke the initFindForm() method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned string is not an unexpected value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method does not return an unexpected value. This is crucial as returning an unexpected string could lead to incorrect mapping to a view in the application.
