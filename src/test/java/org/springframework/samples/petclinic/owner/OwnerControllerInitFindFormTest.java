================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The usage of third-party libraries without checking their integrity can lead to the execution of malicious code if the libraries are tampered with.
Solution: Ensure to download libraries from trusted sources and perform a checksum validation to ensure the integrity of the libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The code does not seem to sanitize user input before using it in web page generation, which can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Use proper input validation and sanitization techniques to neutralize potentially harmful characters in user input. Use encoding libraries like OWASP Java Encoder for output encoding.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The code does not seem to implement any CSRF tokens in the form, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
Solution: Implement CSRF tokens in your forms. Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection that can be enabled in the configuration.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Detailed error messages can expose sensitive information or system details to an attacker.
Solution: Implement proper error handling and logging. Do not reveal sensitive system information in error messages displayed to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Sensitive information should not be passed in query strings, as they can be exposed in logs or browser history.
Solution: Use POST requests to send sensitive data or store sensitive data in server-side sessions or cookies with proper encryption and flags.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Correct Return String
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitFindFormReturnString.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the initFindForm() method returns the correct string "owners/findOwners". 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the initFindForm() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string is "owners/findOwners".
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the initFindForm() method returns the correct string. This is significant because it indicates the correct web page is being directed to.

Scenario 2: Test for Non-Null Return String
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitFindFormNonNullReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the initFindForm() method does not return null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the initFindForm() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the initFindForm() method does not return null. This is significant because a null return could cause NullPointerExceptions elsewhere in the code.

Scenario 3: Test for Correct Return String Case
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitFindFormCorrectCaseReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the initFindForm() method returns the correct case string "owners/findOwners". 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary as the method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the initFindForm() method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string is "owners/findOwners" with correct case.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the initFindForm() method returns the string "owners/findOwners" in the correct case. This is significant because the web page routing is case sensitive.
