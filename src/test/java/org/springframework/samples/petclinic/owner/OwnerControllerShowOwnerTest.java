================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The code uses a findById() method to retrieve an Owner object. If this method is not properly implemented, it may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the findById() method uses prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. If possible, use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to handle database operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code is not validating the ownerId before it is used in the findById() method. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if an invalid or malicious ownerId is provided.
Solution: Implement input validation for ownerId. Ensure it is a valid integer before using it in the findById() method.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The code adds the entire Owner object to the ModelAndView. This could potentially expose sensitive user information to the view layer, depending on the properties of the Owner object.
Solution: Limit the information added to the ModelAndView by only adding necessary attributes of the Owner object. Never expose sensitive information like passwords or other personally identifiable information.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test when owner exists in the system
Details:  
  TestName: testShowOwnerWhenOwnerExists
  Description: This test is meant to check the scenario when the ownerId passed to the showOwner method corresponds to an existing owner. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the owners.findById method to return a valid Owner object when passed the test ownerId.
    Act: Invoke the showOwner method with the test ownerId.
    Assert: Assert that the ModelAndView object returned by the method contains the expected Owner object.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the showOwner method correctly retrieves and returns the details of an existing owner. The expected result is that the ModelAndView object contains the correct Owner object. This test is significant in ensuring that the application correctly displays owner details when requested.

Scenario 2: Test when owner does not exist in the system
Details:  
  TestName: testShowOwnerWhenOwnerDoesNotExist
  Description: This test is meant to check the scenario when the ownerId passed to the showOwner method does not correspond to any existing owner. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the owners.findById method to return null when passed the test ownerId.
    Act: Invoke the showOwner method with the test ownerId.
    Assert: Assert that the ModelAndView object returned by the method does not contain an Owner object.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the showOwner method correctly handles the case where the requested owner does not exist. The expected result is that the ModelAndView object does not contain an Owner object. This test is significant in ensuring that the application appropriately handles requests for non-existent owners.

Scenario 3: Test with invalid ownerId
Details:  
  TestName: testShowOwnerWithInvalidOwnerId
  Description: This test is meant to check the scenario when the ownerId passed to the showOwner method is invalid (e.g., negative). 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to mock anything in this case.
    Act: Invoke the showOwner method with a negative ownerId.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test validates that the showOwner method correctly handles invalid input. The expected result is that an exception is thrown. This test is significant in ensuring that the application appropriately handles invalid requests.
