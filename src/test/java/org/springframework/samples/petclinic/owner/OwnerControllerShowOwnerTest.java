================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the findById method in the owners object uses string concatenation for creating SQL query, it might lead to SQL Injection.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries or ORM libraries to avoid SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing all properties of the Owner object can potentially reveal sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure the Owner object does not contain sensitive data before sending it to the view. Alternatively, create a Data Transfer Object (DTO) with only the necessary fields.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: If the ownerId parameter is used to access file system resources, it might lead to Path Traversal attacks.
Solution: Avoid using user inputs to access file system resources. If it's necessary, validate the input to ensure it does not break out of the intended directory.
