================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The code uses a findById() method to retrieve an Owner object. If this method is not properly implemented, it may be vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.
Solution: Ensure that the findById() method uses prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks. Here's how you can use prepared statements in Spring Data JPA: Owner owner = this.owners.findById(new SqlParameterSource(new MapSqlParameterSource().addValue("ownerId", ownerId)));

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the ownerId input before using it. If an attacker provides an invalid or malicious ownerId, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Validate the ownerId input before using it. For example: if (ownerId <= 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid owner id"); }

Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improper Error Handling
Issue: If the findById() method does not find an Owner with the given ownerId, it might return null. The code does not check for this possibility, which could lead to a NullPointerException.
Solution: Check if the Owner object is null before using it. For example: if (owner == null) { throw new NotFoundException("Owner not found"); }

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for valid owner ID

Details:  
  TestName: testShowOwnerWithValidId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method can successfully retrieve and display the details of the owner when a valid owner ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `owners` object to return a specific `Owner` object when `findById` is called with the valid owner ID.
  Act: Call `showOwner` method with the valid owner ID.
  Assert: Check if the returned `ModelAndView` object contains the expected `Owner` object and has the expected view name.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can correctly retrieve and display the details of an owner with a valid ID. This is significant as it is the main functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test for invalid owner ID

Details:  
  TestName: testShowOwnerWithInvalidId
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the situation when an invalid owner ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `owners` object to return `null` when `findById` is called with the invalid owner ID.
  Act: Call `showOwner` method with the invalid owner ID.
  Assert: Check if the returned `ModelAndView` object contains `null` and has the expected view name.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can correctly handle the situation when an invalid owner ID is provided. This is significant as it tests the method's error handling capability.

Scenario 3: Test for owner ID not found

Details:  
  TestName: testShowOwnerWithIdNotFound
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the situation when a non-existent owner ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `owners` object to throw an exception when `findById` is called with the non-existent owner ID.
  Act: Call `showOwner` method with the non-existent owner ID.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method can correctly handle the situation when a non-existent owner ID is provided. This is significant as it tests the method's error handling capability.
