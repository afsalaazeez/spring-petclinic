================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-943: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Issue: The method processCreationForm redirects to a URL that includes the owner ID. This could expose sensitive information and allow unauthorized access.
Solution: To prevent IDOR, avoid exposing direct object references to users. Consider using indirect object references mapped to the user's session. Also, implement access controls to verify the user is authorized to access the specific resource.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The application trusts the BindingResult.hasErrors() function to prevent the creation of a new owner when there are input errors. An attacker may bypass this function and create a new owner with invalid data.
Solution: Do not solely rely on client-side validation, as it can be easily bypassed. Implement server-side validation and sanitize all inputs to ensure they are safe before using them in your application.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The application redirects the user to a new URL based on the owner ID. An attacker could manipulate the owner ID to redirect a user to an untrusted site.
Solution: Always validate the URL to which you are redirecting to ensure that it points to a trusted and safe location.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Owner Creation with Valid Input

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessCreationFormWithValidInput
  Description: This test is designed to check if a new owner is created successfully when the input data is valid. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Owner object with valid data. Do not mock any errors in BindingResult.
  Act: Call the processCreationForm method with the mocked Owner object and BindingResult.
  Assert: Check if the return value is a redirect to the new owner's page and if a success message is flashed.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the owner creation process works correctly with valid data. The expected result is a redirection to the new owner's page, which indicates successful creation. The success message flashed also helps confirm this.

Scenario 2: Test Owner Creation with Invalid Input

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessCreationFormWithInvalidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the application handles invalid inputs correctly during owner creation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Owner object with invalid data. Mock errors in BindingResult.
  Act: Call the processCreationForm method with the mocked Owner object and BindingResult.
  Assert: Check if the return value is the owner creation form and if an error message is flashed.
Validation: 
  The test aims to verify that the application properly handles invalid inputs, by returning the user back to the form and flashing an error message. This ensures that users are prompted to correct their input before an owner is created.

Scenario 3: Test Owner Persistence

Details:  
  TestName: testOwnerPersistenceAfterCreation
  Description: This test is meant to check if the newly created owner is saved into the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Owner object with valid data. Do not mock any errors in BindingResult.
  Act: Call the processCreationForm method with the mocked Owner object and BindingResult.
  Assert: Verify that the save method was called on the owners repository.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the owner is persisted after successful creation. The expected result is a call to the save method on the owners repository. This is important to ensure that the owner data is stored for later retrieval.
