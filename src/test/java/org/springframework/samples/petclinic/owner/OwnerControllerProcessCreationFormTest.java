================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The method processCreationForm redirects the user to a URL that includes input from the user without validation. This can lead to URL Redirection attacks, where the user can be redirected to malicious sites.
Solution: Ensure that the redirection URL is a valid and trusted URL. You can maintain a list of trusted URLs and only redirect to those, or you can avoid using user input in the redirection URL.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The method processCreationForm saves user input to the database without validation or parameterization. This can lead to SQL Injection attacks, where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure that user input is not executed as SQL code.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: The method processCreationForm uses user input in error messages and other output without sanitization. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks, where an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
Solution: Sanitize user input before using it in output. You can use HTML escaping to ensure that user input is not interpreted as HTML or JavaScript code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test when the owner creation form has errors
  Details:  
    TestName: testProcessCreationFormWithErrors
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles the scenario where there are errors in the owner creation form. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock Owner object and a BindingResult object with errors. Set up a mock RedirectAttributes object.
    Act: Invoke the processCreationForm method with the mock Owner, BindingResult, and RedirectAttributes objects.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string is equal to the expected view name for the owner creation or update form.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly redirects to the owner creation or update form when there are errors in the owner creation form. This is important as it ensures the user is prompted to correct errors in the form before a new owner is saved.

Scenario 2: Test successful owner creation
  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulOwnerCreation
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly creates a new owner when the owner creation form does not have any errors.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock Owner object and a BindingResult object without errors. Set up a mock RedirectAttributes object. Mock the save method of the owners repository to save the Owner object.
    Act: Invoke the processCreationForm method with the mock Owner, BindingResult, and RedirectAttributes objects.
    Assert: Assert that the returned string is equal to the expected redirect URL with the new owner's ID.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly redirects to the new owner's details page after successfully creating a new owner. This is crucial as it confirms the successful creation and saving of a new owner.

Scenario 3: Test owner creation form with null Owner object
  Details:  
    TestName: testProcessCreationFormWithNullOwner
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles the scenario where a null Owner object is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null Owner object and a BindingResult object. Set up a mock RedirectAttributes object.
    Act: Invoke the processCreationForm method with the null Owner, BindingResult, and RedirectAttributes objects.
    Assert: Assert that the BindingResult object has errors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies the error when a null Owner object is passed. This is important as it ensures the method can handle null input and prevent a NullPointerException.

Scenario 4: Test owner creation form with null BindingResult object
  Details:  
    TestName: testProcessCreationFormWithNullBindingResult
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles the scenario where a null BindingResult object is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock Owner object and a null BindingResult object. Set up a mock RedirectAttributes object.
    Act: Invoke the processCreationForm method with the mock Owner, null BindingResult, and RedirectAttributes objects.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when a null BindingResult object is passed. This is crucial as it confirms the method's requirement for a valid BindingResult object to function correctly.
