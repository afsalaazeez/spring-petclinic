================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The method `findOwner()` does not seem to sanitize the `ownerId` before it is used in a query. This could lead to SQL injection if an attacker provides a maliciously crafted ownerId.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. For instance, with Spring Data JPA, you can use the `@Param` annotation in your repository methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: The code does not seem to handle user sessions, which could lead to session fixation or session hijacking attacks if user sessions are not properly managed and expired.
Solution: Implement session management using Spring Security and ensure sessions are expired after a reasonable period of inactivity.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: By returning a new Owner object when the ownerId is not found, the code may inadvertently give permissions to an unauthenticated user.
Solution: Ensure proper authorization checks are performed before returning any sensitive information. If the ownerId is not found, consider returning an error or exception.

"""
Scenario 1: Test findOwner with valid ownerId

Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithValidId.
  Description: This test is designed to check the findOwner method when a valid ownerId is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Owner object and the owners.findById method to return the mocked Owner object when called with a specific ownerId.
  Act: Call the findOwner method with a valid ownerId.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Owner object is the same as the mocked Owner object.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the findOwner method returns the correct Owner object when a valid ownerId is provided. 
  This is important to ensure that the correct Owner data is returned when queried with a valid ownerId.

Scenario 2: Test findOwner without ownerId

Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithoutId.
  Description: This test is designed to check the findOwner method when no ownerId is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as no ownerId is passed.
  Act: Call the findOwner method without an ownerId.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Owner object is a new Owner object.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the findOwner method returns a new Owner object when no ownerId is provided. 
  This is important to ensure that a new Owner object is correctly instantiated when no ownerId is passed.

Scenario 3: Test findOwner with non-existing ownerId

Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithNonExistingId.
  Description: This test is designed to check the findOwner method when a non-existing ownerId is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the owners.findById method to return null when called with a specific non-existing ownerId.
  Act: Call the findOwner method with a non-existing ownerId.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Owner object is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the findOwner method returns null when a non-existing ownerId is provided. 
  This is important to ensure that the method handles non-existing ownerIds correctly and does not return incorrect data.
