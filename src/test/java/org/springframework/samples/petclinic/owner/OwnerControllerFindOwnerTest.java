================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The method `findOwner` does not seem to sanitize the `ownerId` before it is used in a query. This could lead to SQL injection if an attacker provides a maliciously crafted ownerId.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. For instance, with Spring Data JPA, you can use the `@Param` annotation in your repository methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: The code does not seem to handle session management, which could lead to session hijacking or session sidejacking attacks if not properly implemented in the broader application context.
Solution: Ensure to manage sessions properly. Use Spring Security's session management to automatically timeout inactive sessions.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The method `findOwner` is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere within the application. If this method is not intended to be used widely, it could lead to unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Limit the visibility of your methods as much as possible. If a method does not need to be public, consider making it private or protected.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The `findOwner` method returns an `Owner` object which could contain sensitive information. If this data is not properly handled, it could lead to exposure of private information.
Solution: Ensure to handle sensitive data properly. Consider using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to only expose necessary data to the client.

Scenario 1: Find an Owner with a Valid Owner ID
Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithValidId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findOwner method can correctly fetch the details of an Owner when provided with a valid owner ID. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the owners object to return a specific Owner when findById is called with a valid owner ID. 
  Act: Call findOwner with a valid owner ID.
  Assert: Check if the returned Owner matches the one returned by the mock.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the findOwner method can correctly fetch an Owner's details when a valid owner ID is provided. It validates the method's functionality under normal usage conditions.

Scenario 2: Find an Owner without Providing an Owner ID
Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithoutId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findOwner method can handle a situation where no owner ID is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as no ID is provided.
  Act: Call findOwner with null as the owner ID.
  Assert: Check if the returned Owner is a new, empty Owner object.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the findOwner method can handle the situation where no owner ID is provided by returning a new, empty Owner object. This is an important test to ensure that the method can handle edge cases gracefully.

Scenario 3: Find an Owner with an Invalid Owner ID
Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithInvalidId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the findOwner method can handle a situation where an invalid owner ID is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the owners object to return null when findById is called with an invalid owner ID. 
  Act: Call findOwner with an invalid owner ID.
  Assert: Check if the returned Owner is null.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the findOwner method can handle the situation where an invalid owner ID is provided by returning null. This test is important for ensuring that the method can handle error scenarios without crashing.
