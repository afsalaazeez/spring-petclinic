================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The code uses a query with concatenated strings which could lead to SQL Injection attack if the ownerId variable is controlled by the user.
Solution: Use PreparedStatement or use other SQL parameter binding methods to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the ownerId input. If the ownerId is directly coming from the user input, it can lead to unexpected behavior.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize the inputs. Implement checks to ensure that ownerId is of correct form and type.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not handle the case where the method this.owners.findById(ownerId) might return a null. This can lead to a NullPointerException.
Solution: Always check if the returned value from a method is not null before using it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check null ownerId
Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithNullId
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the findOwner method when the ownerId is null. It's expected to return a new Owner object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed as no data is provided.
    Act: Invoke the findOwner method with null as the ownerId.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is a new Owner.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles null ownerId and returns a new Owner object. This is significant as it prevents null pointer exceptions.

Scenario 2: Test to check valid ownerId
Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithValidId
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the findOwner method when a valid ownerId is provided. It's expected to return the Owner object with the given Id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock for the owners repository to return a specific Owner when findById is called.
    Act: Invoke the findOwner method with a valid ownerId.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object matches the Owner set in the mock.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly fetches the Owner with the given Id. This is significant as it ensures the correct Owner data is retrieved.

Scenario 3: Test to check invalid ownerId
Details:  
  TestName: testFindOwnerWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks the functionality of the findOwner method when an invalid ownerId is provided. It's expected to return null as no Owner with the given Id is present.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a mock for the owners repository to return null when findById is called with the invalid Id.
    Act: Invoke the findOwner method with an invalid ownerId.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned object is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles invalid ownerId and returns null. This is significant as it ensures the method doesn't throw an exception when an invalid Id is provided.
