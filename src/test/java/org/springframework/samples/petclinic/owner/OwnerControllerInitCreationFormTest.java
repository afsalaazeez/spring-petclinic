================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code uses 'springframework' and 'jakarta' libraries. If these libraries are not properly validated before use, it might lead to use of compromised libraries.
Solution: Always ensure to use official and secure sources for downloading libraries. Validate the integrity of libraries using checksums or digital signatures.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the 'initCreationForm' method, an exception might occur which is not handled. This can lead to exposure of sensitive information through error messages.
Solution: Implement exception handling and logging mechanisms. Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If any sensitive data is passed in the 'GetMapping' or 'PostMapping' methods as query strings, it can be exposed because the data in query strings are logged in various places such as browser history, logs, etc.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive information as query parameters in GET requests. Use POST requests instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'model.put' in 'initCreationForm' is putting the 'Owner' object into the model. If this object contains sensitive information, it can lead to exposure of private information.
Solution: Ensure only necessary information is added to the model. If sensitive data is necessary, ensure it is properly encrypted and decrypted.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
Issue: If XML data is processed using the application, it can lead to XXE attacks if not properly handled.
Solution: If XML processing is used, ensure to disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions), or at least configure your XML parser to not resolve external entities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Creation of Owner and Update of Model
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitCreationFormSuccess
    Description: This test will check the successful execution of the initCreationForm method. It should create a new Owner object and add it to the model. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the Map model.
    Act: Invoke the initCreationForm method with the mocked model. 
    Assert: Assert that the model contains an attribute named "owner" and its value is an instance of Owner class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that a new Owner object is created and added to the model. This is the expected behavior as per the method implementation. This test is significant to ensure that the method is correctly initializing the form with a new Owner instance.

Scenario 2: Model Update with Null Value
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitCreationFormWithNullModel
    Description: This test will check the behavior of the initCreationForm method when passed a null model. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the model to null.
    Act: Invoke the initCreationForm method with a null model. 
    Assert: The test should handle the null input and not throw an exception.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method can handle null input gracefully. In case of null input, the method should not throw an exception but handle it gracefully. This test is significant to ensure the robustness of the method against null inputs.

Scenario 3: Model Update with Existing Owner
  Details:  
    TestName: testInitCreationFormWithExistingOwner
    Description: This test will check the behavior of the initCreationForm method when the model already contains an "owner" attribute. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the Map model and add an existing Owner object.
    Act: Invoke the initCreationForm method with the mocked model. 
    Assert: Assert that the "owner" attribute in the model is replaced with a new Owner instance.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method can correctly replace an existing "owner" attribute in the model. This test is important to ensure that the method can correctly initialize the form even when the model already contains an "owner" attribute.
