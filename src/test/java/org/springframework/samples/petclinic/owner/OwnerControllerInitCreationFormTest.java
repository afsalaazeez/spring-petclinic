================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The application is using dependencies, such as Spring and Jakarta, which are downloaded from the internet. If the integrity of these dependencies is not verified, it could lead to the execution of malicious code.
Solution: Use a dependency checking tool to ensure the integrity of your dependencies. Make sure to download dependencies over a secure connection.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The application is using user inputs to create an Owner object, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated and sanitized.
Solution: Use input validation techniques, such as whitelisting acceptable inputs, to ensure that only expected inputs are processed by the application.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: The application may contain URL redirection, which could be used by an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks.
Solution: Avoid using user input in the destination of URL redirections. If unavoidable, validate the input to ensure it is safe.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate the creation of new Owner object

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormNewOwnerObject
  Description: This test is to validate that a new Owner object is created when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is a new instance of Owner.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that a new Owner object is created. This is important to ensure the application can create new Owners when needed.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the correct form view is returned

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormReturnsCorrectView
  Description: This test is to validate that the correct view is returned when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned view is equal to VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the correct view is returned. This is important to ensure the application navigates to the correct page when creating a new Owner.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the correct Owner object is added to the model

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormAddsOwnerToModel
  Description: This test is to validate that the correct Owner object is added to the model when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the model contains an attribute "owner".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the correct Owner object is added to the model. This is important to ensure that the model has all the necessary data for the view.
  
Scenario 4: Test to validate the Owner object in the model is a new instance

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormAddsNewOwnerInstanceToModel
  Description: This test is to validate that the Owner object added to the model is a new instance when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the Owner object in the model is a new instance.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Owner object in the model is a new instance. This is important to ensure that the application is ready to accept new data for a new Owner.
