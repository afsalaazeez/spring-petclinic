================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The application is using dependencies, such as Spring and Jakarta, which are downloaded from the internet. If the integrity of these dependencies is not verified, it could lead to the execution of malicious code.
Solution: Use a dependency checking tool to ensure the integrity of your dependencies. Make sure to download dependencies from trusted sources and verify their checksums or use signed versions.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: The application appears to be using a SQL database, but it's not clear if user inputs are being properly sanitized. If not, it could lead to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Make sure to sanitize all user inputs or use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The application does not seem to be using any form of randomness for sensitive operations. Lack of randomness can lead to predictability, making the application vulnerable to attacks.
Solution: Ensure the use of a secure random number generator where randomness is required for security-related functionality.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The application does not seem to have any code related to permission checking. If the application data is not properly protected, it could lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that appropriate permissions are set for all data and that permission checks are performed whenever data is accessed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate the creation of new Owner object

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormNewOwnerObject
  Description: This test is to validate that a new Owner object is created when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is a new instance of Owner.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that a new Owner object is created. This is important to ensure the application can create new Owners when needed.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the correct form view is returned

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormReturnsCorrectView
  Description: This test is to validate that the correct view is returned when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned view is equal to VIEWS_OWNER_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FORM.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the correct view is returned. This is important to ensure the application navigates to the correct page when creating a new Owner.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the correct Owner object is added to the model

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormAddsOwnerToModel
  Description: This test is to validate that the correct Owner object is added to the model when the initCreationForm method is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the model contains an attribute "owner".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the correct Owner object is added to the model. This is important to ensure that the model has all the necessary data for the view.
  
Scenario 4: Test to validate the model remains unchanged if the method throws an exception

Details:  
  TestName: testInitCreationFormExceptionHandling
  Description: This test is to validate that the model remains unchanged if the initCreationForm method throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new HashMap to mimic the Map model.
  Act: Call the initCreationForm method with the created HashMap as a parameter and simulate an exception.
  Assert: Assert that the model remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the model remains unchanged in case of an exception. This is important to ensure the application's robustness and error-handling capabilities.
