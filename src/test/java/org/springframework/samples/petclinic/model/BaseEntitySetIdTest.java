================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The setter method allows the ID of an object to be changed. If this ID is used to reference objects directly, an attacker may manipulate the ID to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct object references to the client. Use indirect object references mapped to the user's session.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
Issue: If the 'id' field is used in file operations, and the input is not validated, it could lead to uploading files with dangerous types.
Solution: Implement strong validation for file types and contents before handling them.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If the 'id' field is reflected in a web page without proper encoding, it could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
Solution: Always encode user inputs before reflecting them in a web page.

"""
Scenario 1: Test setId with a valid non-null integer id

Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithValidId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setId method functions correctly when provided with a valid non-null integer id. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement or setup is necessary for this test as the method does not depend on any other data, mocks, or test doubles. 
  Act: Invoke the setId method with a valid non-null integer id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id has been set correctly.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the id has been set correctly. The expected result is that the id is equal to the provided integer. This test is significant in ensuring that the setId method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test setId with a null id

Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check the setId method's handling of null input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement or setup is necessary for this test as the method does not depend on any other data, mocks, or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with a null id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id has been set to null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the id has been set to null. The expected result is that the id is null. This test is significant in ensuring that the setId method correctly handles null input.

Scenario 3: Test setId with negative integer id

Details:  
  TestName: testSetIdWithNegativeId
  Description: This test is meant to check the setId method's handling of negative integer inputs. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement or setup is necessary for this test as the method does not depend on any other data, mocks, or test doubles.
  Act: Invoke the setId method with a negative integer id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the id has been set to the negative integer.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the id has been set to the negative integer. The expected result is that the id is equal to the provided negative integer. This test is significant in ensuring that the setId method correctly handles negative integer inputs.
