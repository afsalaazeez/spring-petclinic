================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The 'getFirstName()' method is public and might expose sensitive user information if it's not properly handled. This could lead to privacy violation, where an attacker could access sensitive user information.
Solution: Ensure any sensitive information returned by this method is properly protected. You could also change the method access level to protected or package-private if it's not necessary to be public.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the 'getFirstName()' method is used in a GET request, sensitive information could be exposed in the URL. URLs are logged in browser history, web server logs, and other places, which could expose sensitive user information.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in GET requests. Use POST requests instead, or encrypt sensitive data before adding it to the URL.

""" 
Scenario 1: Test to validate the return of correct firstName

Details:  
  TestName: testGetFirstName.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFirstName method returns the correct firstName stored in the firstName variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set a known firstName.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned firstName is the same as the one set in the Arrange step.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method correctly retrieves the firstName. The expected result is the same firstName that was set in the Arrange step, as the getFirstName method should simply return the current value of the firstName.

Scenario 2: Test to validate null firstName handling

Details:  
  TestName: testGetFirstNameWithNullValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFirstName method handles null values correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, do not set a firstName (which should default to null).
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned firstName is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method correctly handles null values. The expected result is null since we did not set a firstName in the Arrange step.

Scenario 3: Test to check the behavior of getFirstName method with empty firstName

Details:  
  TestName: testGetFirstNameWithEmptyValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFirstName method handles empty string as firstName.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the firstName as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned firstName is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method correctly handles an empty string. The expected result is an empty string, as that was the value set in the Arrange step.
