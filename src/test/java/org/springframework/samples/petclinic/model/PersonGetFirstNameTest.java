================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The given code snippet does not seem to contain any user input validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to information leakage if sensitive data is passed through the getFirstName() method.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input. You can use Java's built-in features or third-party libraries to achieve this. Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed through query strings or any other insecure methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code snippet provided is a getter method that returns a user's first name. If this method was used for debugging purposes and left in the production code, it could expose sensitive user information.
Solution: Remove all debugging code or guard it with a condition that ensures it only runs in a debug environment. Use logging libraries that can be configured to disable certain log levels in production.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the firstName field contains sensitive data, the getFirstName() method can lead to privacy violation as it directly exposes this information.
Solution: Ensure that you are not exposing sensitive information through your getter methods. If necessary, apply appropriate encryption or hashing methods to sensitive fields.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Test to validate the return of correct firstName

Details:  
  TestName: testGetFirstName.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFirstName method returns the correct firstName stored in the firstName variable.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set a known firstName.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned firstName is the same as the one set in the Arrange step.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method is working correctly and returns the correct firstName. This is crucial for the application behavior as it ensures that the correct firstName is returned when requested.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the return of null when firstName is null

Details:  
  TestName: testGetFirstNameWhenNull.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFirstName method returns null when the firstName is not set or null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, do not set a firstName (leave it null).
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned firstName is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method handles null values correctly and does not throw an exception. This is important for the application behavior as it prevents unexpected errors when the firstName is not set.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the return of empty string when firstName is empty

Details:  
  TestName: testGetFirstNameWhenEmpty.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getFirstName method returns an empty string when the firstName is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the firstName to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getFirstName method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned firstName is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getFirstName method handles empty strings correctly and does not throw an exception. This is important for the application behavior as it prevents unexpected errors when the firstName is an empty string.
