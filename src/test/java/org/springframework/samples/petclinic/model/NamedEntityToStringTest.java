================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: The current code does not show if it handles XML data, but if it does, it could be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. This could allow an attacker to view files on the application server, interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can communicate with, or perform a Denial-of-Service attack.
Solution: Ensure that any XML parsing in the application is done in a way that disables DTDs (Document Type Definitions). Depending on the parser being used, this could be a feature that needs to be turned on, or it could be achieved by catching the appropriate exception. If DTDs cannot be disabled, consider using a different XML parser that allows DTDs to be disabled.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The toString() method is returning the name directly, which could lead to exposure of sensitive information if the 'name' field contains sensitive data. This could be exploited by an attacker to gain further information about the system or the user.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information in toString() methods. If it's necessary, make sure to sanitize the data before returning it.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code does not specify any access modifiers, meaning that the method will have default access. This could lead to unintended access to the method within the same package.
Solution: Specify an appropriate access modifier for the method. If the method should only be accessible within the class, use the 'private' keyword. If it should be accessible anywhere, use 'public'. If it should be accessible within the class and any subclasses, use 'protected'.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test the toString method when a valid name is returned

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidNameReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns the correct name when the object has a valid name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an object with a valid name.
    Act: Invoke the toString method of the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected name.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly returns the name of the object. The expected result is the name of the object because that is the expected behavior of the toString method. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method is functioning correctly.

  Scenario 2: Test the toString method when the object's name is null

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullNameReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns null when the object's name is null.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an object with a null name.
    Act: Invoke the toString method of the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles a null name. The expected result is null because that is the name of the object. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method can handle null names without causing errors.

  Scenario 3: Test the toString method when the object's name is an empty string

  Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyNameReturn.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns an empty string when the object's name is an empty string.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an object with an empty string name.
    Act: Invoke the toString method of the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles an empty string name. The expected result is an empty string because that is the name of the object. This test is significant in ensuring that the toString method can handle empty string names without causing errors.
