================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The method 'toString()' returns the name of an object which might be controlled by an untrusted source. This can lead to a variety of security issues, including Injection vulnerabilities and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Solution: Always validate and sanitize inputs from untrusted sources. You could use a library like OWASP Java Encoder for HTML encoding to prevent XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration
Issue: While this code snippet doesn't include session handling, it's crucial to remember that in Java applications, especially those using frameworks like Spring, session management should be handled carefully to prevent unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure that sessions are expired properly after a certain period of inactivity. Spring Security provides session management capabilities that can be configured to automatically expire sessions.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The 'toString()' method might be logging or displaying sensitive information which can lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Ensure that no sensitive information is being logged or displayed. If necessary, redact or anonymize sensitive information before logging.

Vulnerability: CWE-328: Reversible One-Way Hash
Issue: While not directly shown in this code, it's important to remember that when storing sensitive data like passwords, they should be hashed and not encrypted. Reversible encryption for passwords can lead to them being compromised.
Solution: Use a strong one-way hash function to store passwords. Java provides 'MessageDigest' class that can be used to generate one-way hash.

"""
  Scenario 1: Testing the Normal Scenario

  Details:  
    TestName: testToStringNormalScenario.
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal functionality of the toString method. It is aimed at a scenario where the getName method returns a non-null String value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set a name using the setName method. 
    Act: Invoke the toString method. 
    Assert: Compare the output of the toString method with the value set using the setName method.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the toString method returns the correct name. This test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the toString method.

  Scenario 2: Testing the Null Scenario

  Details:  
    TestName: testToStringNullScenario.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the toString method when the getName method returns a null value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class, do not set a name. 
    Act: Invoke the toString method. 
    Assert: Compare the output of the toString method with null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles null values. This test is significant as it tests the robustness of the toString method.

  Scenario 3: Testing the Empty String Scenario

  Details:  
    TestName: testToStringEmptyStringScenario.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the toString method when the getName method returns an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the name as an empty string using the setName method. 
    Act: Invoke the toString method. 
    Assert: Compare the output of the toString method with an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles empty strings. This test is significant as it tests the edge case of the toString method.
