================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setFirstName() method is not validating the input before setting the firstName. This could make the application vulnerable to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection, if the firstName is used in any HTML or SQL context.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure only valid characters are allowed. For example, if the firstName should only contain alphabets, the validation could look like this:

public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
  if (!firstName.matches("[a-zA-Z]+")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid characters in firstName");
  }
  this.firstName = firstName;
}

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the firstName is sensitive data, it could be exposed if it is not properly protected. This could lead to violation of privacy.
Solution: Ensure that the firstName is not logged or exposed in error messages or any other unintended ways. Also, consider encrypting the firstName if it is stored or transmitted.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If the firstName is used in creating a URL, it could be manipulated to redirect users to an untrusted site.
Solution: Avoid using user inputs to create URLs. If it is unavoidable, ensure to validate the URL to prevent redirection to untrusted sites.

  Scenario 1: Valid First Name Test

  Details:  
    TestName: setValidFirstName.
    Description: This test checks if the method correctly sets the first name when a valid string is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid first name.
    Act: Invoke the setFirstName method with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the first name is set correctly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the first name was set correctly. This is important for the correct functioning of other parts of the application that rely on this data.

  Scenario 2: Null First Name Test

  Details:  
    TestName: setNullFirstName.
    Description: This test checks how the method handles null input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null string.
    Act: Invoke the setFirstName method with the null string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the first name is set to null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the first name is set to null when a null string is passed. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle null inputs gracefully.

  Scenario 3: Empty First Name Test

  Details:

    Description: This test checks how the method handles an empty string as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setFirstName method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the first name is set to an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the first name is set to an empty string when an empty string is passed. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle different types of string inputs.

  Scenario 4: First Name With Spaces Test

  Details:  
    TestName: setFirstNameWithSpaces.
    Description: This test checks how the method handles a string with spaces as input. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with spaces.
    Act: Invoke the setFirstName method with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the first name is set correctly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the first name is set correctly even when the input string contains spaces. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle different types of string inputs.
