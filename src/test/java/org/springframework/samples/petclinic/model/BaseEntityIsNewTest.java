================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The method isNew() checks if the 'id' is null. If 'id' is accidentally dereferenced before this check, it could lead to a Null Pointer Exception crash. In a worst-case scenario, this could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Ensure 'id' is always checked for null before being dereferenced. Consider using Optional in Java 8 to avoid null pointer exceptions.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when ID is null

Details:  
  TestName: testIsNewWhenIdIsNull.
  Description: This test aims to check whether the isNew() method correctly identifies that an object is new when the ID is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a null ID.
  Act: Invoke the isNew() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the isNew() method correctly identifies objects with null ID as new. This is crucial as it helps in differentiating new objects from existing ones in the database.

Scenario 2: Test when ID is not null

Details:  
  TestName: testIsNewWhenIdIsNotNull.
  Description: This test aims to check whether the isNew() method correctly identifies that an object is not new when the ID is not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a non-null ID.
  Act: Invoke the isNew() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the isNew() method correctly identifies objects with non-null ID as not new. This helps in preventing unnecessary database operations like redundant insertion of existing objects.

Scenario 3: Test when ID is initially null but set later

Details:  
  TestName: testIsNewWhenIdIsSetLater.
  Description: This test aims to check whether the isNew() method correctly identifies that an object is not new when the ID is initially null but set later.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a null ID, then set a non-null ID.
  Act: Invoke the isNew() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the isNew() method is responsive to changes in the object's ID. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the database and ensuring that objects are properly tracked.

Scenario 4: Test when ID is initially not null but set to null later

Details:  
  TestName: testIsNewWhenIdIsSetToNullLater.
  Description: This test aims to check whether the isNew() method correctly identifies that an object is new when the ID is initially not null but set to null later.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a non-null ID, then set the ID to null.
  Act: Invoke the isNew() method on the object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the isNew() method is responsive to changes in the object's ID. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the database and ensuring that objects are properly tracked.
