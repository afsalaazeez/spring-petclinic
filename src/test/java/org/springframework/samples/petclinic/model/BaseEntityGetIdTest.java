================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The getId() method is public which might expose sensitive information. If an attacker gains access to this method, they could retrieve the ID of the object, which could potentially be used for further attacks.
Solution: Change the access level of the getId() method to private or protected if it does not need to be accessed outside of its class or package. If external access is necessary, consider implementing access controls or other checks to ensure only authorized entities can call the method.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getId() method returns a private ID field. If this ID is sensitive (e.g., it is used for authentication or as a key in a database), this could lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive fields are not directly accessible by methods. Consider using a different, non-sensitive value to represent objects externally, and keep sensitive IDs internal to the object.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if getId returns the correct value

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getId method is returning the correct id value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Compare the returned id with the expected id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is functioning correctly and returning the expected id. This is important for ensuring data integrity and correct application behavior.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getId returns null for uninitialized id

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullForUninitializedId
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getId method is returning null for an uninitialized id. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting the id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Check if the returned id is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is handling uninitialized id correctly by returning null. This is important for preventing null pointer exceptions and ensuring correct application behavior.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getId returns the correct value after id is updated

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsUpdatedValue
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getId method is returning the updated id value after the id is changed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set the id, then update the id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Compare the returned id with the updated id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is reflecting changes to the id correctly. This is important for ensuring data integrity and correct application behavior.

Scenario 4: Test to check if getId returns the correct value for negative id

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectValueForNegativeId
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getId method is returning the correct value when the id is negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the id to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method.
  Assert: Compare the returned id with the expected negative id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is handling negative id correctly. This is important for ensuring data integrity and correct application behavior.
