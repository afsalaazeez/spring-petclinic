================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code imports packages from third-party libraries. If these libraries are not properly validated for integrity, it could lead to the execution of malicious code.
Solution: Ensure that any third-party libraries used are downloaded from a trusted source and their integrity is checked using checksums or similar means.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getId() method may be used in GET requests, which can expose sensitive information through logs, caches, or the Referer header if the ID is sensitive.
Solution: Avoid exposure of sensitive information in GET requests. If ID is sensitive, use POST requests or other methods to transmit it securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The getId() method can be used for debugging purposes and if left in production code, it can expose sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that all debug code is removed or disabled in the production environment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to ensure getId returns the correct ID value

Details:  
  TestName: verifyCorrectIdIsReturned
  Description: This test checks that the getId method returns the correct ID value. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known ID value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the known ID value set during the Arrange phase.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retrieves the ID of the object. This is important as it ensures the integrity of the object's state.

Scenario 2: Test to ensure getId returns null for objects that do not have an ID set

Details:  
  TestName: verifyNullIdIsReturnedForUninitializedObject
  Description: This test checks that the getId method returns null for objects that do not have an ID set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object without setting an ID value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly handles objects without an ID. This is important as it prevents potential NullPointerExceptions when retrieving the ID.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure getId returns the correct ID after it has been changed

Details:  
  TestName: verifyIdIsUpdatedCorrectly
  Description: This test checks that the getId method returns the new ID after it has been changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known ID value, then change the ID to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned ID matches the new ID value set during the Arrange phase.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly retrieves the updated ID of the object. This is important as it ensures the object's state is accurately reflected after changes.
