================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The getId() method is public which might expose sensitive information. If an attacker gains access to this method, they could retrieve the ID of the object, which could potentially be used for further attacks.
Solution: Change the access level of the getId() method to the most restrictive level that still allows necessary system functionality. If external systems don't need to access the ID, consider making the method private or protected.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The getId() method returns a potentially sensitive piece of information which can be used by an attacker to perform more targeted attacks. This can lead to privacy violation if the ID is linked to personal information.
Solution: Consider not exposing the ID directly. If it's necessary to expose an identifier, use a safe transformation of the ID that doesn't reveal the actual ID value.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in URL
Issue: If the returned ID is used in URL query strings, it could be logged in various places (like browser history, server logs, etc.), leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive information in URL query strings. Use POST methods or secure cookies to pass sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getId method returns the correct Id
Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method is correctly returning the Id of the object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set its Id. 
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual Id returned by the getId method with the expected Id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method returns the correct Id. The expected result is the Id that was set for the object. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures the getId method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getId method returns null when Id is not set
Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullWhenIdNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns null when the Id of the object is not set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class without setting its Id. 
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result of the getId method is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method returns null when the Id is not set. The expected result is null. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures the getId method can handle scenarios where the Id is not set. 

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getId method returns the correct Id after the Id is updated
Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsUpdatedId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns the correct Id after the Id of the object is updated. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object of the class and set its Id. Then update the Id. 
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual Id returned by the getId method with the updated Id.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method returns the updated Id. The expected result is the updated Id. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures the getId method is functioning as expected even after the Id is updated.
