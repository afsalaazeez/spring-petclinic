================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setLastName() method is not validating the input before setting the value. This could make the application vulnerable to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection, if the lastName is used in any HTML or SQL context.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure only valid characters are allowed. For example, if the last name should only contain alphabetic characters, the validation could look like this: if(!lastName.matches("^[a-zA-Z]*$") throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid characters in last name.");

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setLastName() method could potentially be logging sensitive information. If an exception occurs or if there is any logging in the method, the last name could be written to a log file.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is not being logged. If it is necessary to log, consider logging a hash of the sensitive information, or only log the fact that an operation was performed without including the actual data.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The setLastName() method is trusting its input without any form of sanitization or validation. This could lead to various injection attacks.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input data. Never trust input data implicitly. Consider using a library or framework that automatically handles these concerns.

"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Last Name Input

  Details:  
    TestName: setValidLastName.
    Description: The test checks if the method correctly sets the last name when a valid string is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid last name.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the last name was set correctly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set correctly. This test is significant for ensuring basic functionality of the setLastName method.

  Scenario 2: Null Last Name Input

  Details:  
    TestName: setNullLastName.
    Description: The test checks how the method handles a null input for the last name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null string.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the null string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the last name was set to null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set to null. This test is important for ensuring robust error handling in the setLastName method.

  Scenario 3: Empty Last Name Input

  Details:  
    TestName: setEmptyLastName.
    Description: The test checks how the method handles an empty string as the last name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the last name was set to an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set to an empty string. This test is important for ensuring the setLastName method can handle edge cases.

  Scenario 4: Long Last Name Input

  Details:  
    TestName: setLongLastName.
    Description: The test checks how the method handles a very long string as the last name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a length that exceeds the normal length of a last name.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the long string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the last name was set to the long string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set to the long string. This test checks if the setLastName method can handle unusually long inputs.
