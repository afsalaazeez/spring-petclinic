================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setLastName method does not perform any validation checks on the input. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection if the input is directly used in a context that interprets it as code.
Solution: Perform validation checks on the input to make sure it meets certain criteria before using it. For example, check that the input does not contain any script tags or SQL commands.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setLastName method is public which means that it can be called from anywhere, potentially exposing sensitive information.
Solution: Consider making the method private or protected, or ensure that it is only called from trusted code.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code contains import statements that are ended with a semicolon and a comma, which is not typical and may indicate leftover debug code.
Solution: Review the code to ensure that it only contains what is necessary for the application to function properly. Remove any leftover debug code.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the method sets a valid last name

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetValidLastName.
    Description: This test checks if the method setLastName correctly sets a valid last name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string with a valid last name.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the initialized string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set last name against the initialized string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set correctly. This is important for ensuring that user data is accurately recorded and stored.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the method sets an empty last name

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetEmptyLastName.
    Description: This test checks if the method setLastName correctly sets an empty string as the last name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string with an empty value.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set last name against the empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set to an empty string. This is important for ensuring that user data is accurately recorded and stored, even if it is empty.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the method sets a null last name

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetNullLastName.
    Description: This test checks if the method setLastName correctly handles a null last name. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string with a null value.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the null string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the set last name is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set to null. This is important for ensuring that the method correctly handles null inputs, as this could potentially lead to NullPointerExceptions in other parts of the code.

  Scenario 4: Test to check if the method sets a last name with special characters

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetLastNameWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: This test checks if the method setLastName correctly sets a last name that contains special characters. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string with a last name that contains special characters.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the special characters string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set last name against the special characters string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set with special characters. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle last names that contain special characters, as this could potentially lead to data corruption or errors in other parts of the code.

  Scenario 5: Test to check if the method sets a last name with numbers

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetLastNameWithNumbers.
    Description: This test checks if the method setLastName correctly sets a last name that contains numbers. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a string with a last name that contains numbers.
    Act: Invoke the setLastName method with the numbers string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set last name against the numbers string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name was set with numbers. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle last names that contain numbers, as this could potentially lead to data corruption or errors in other parts of the code.
