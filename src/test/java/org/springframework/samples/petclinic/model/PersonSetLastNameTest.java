================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setLastName() method is not validating the input before setting the value. This could make the application vulnerable to attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection, if the input data is used in a context that allows such attacks.
Solution: Implement input validation in the setLastName() method. The validation could be as simple as checking for null values, or it could involve more complex checks, such as checking for illegal characters or patterns.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The setLastName() method could potentially expose sensitive information if an attacker can manipulate the input data. This could lead to a privacy violation.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is properly protected. This could involve encrypting the data before setting it, or ensuring that the method is only accessible to authorized users.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Valid last name input

  Details:  
    TestName: setValidLastName.
    Description: The test checks if the method correctly sets the last name when a valid string is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid last name.
    Act: Invoke setLastName with the valid string.
    Assert: Check if the last name is correctly set in the object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name is correctly set. The test ensures that the method works as expected with valid input.

  Scenario 2: Null last name input

  Details:  
    TestName: setNullLastName.
    Description: The test checks how the method handles null input. Since the method does not have a null check, it is expected to set the last name as null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a null string.
    Act: Invoke setLastName with the null string.
    Assert: Check if the last name is set as null in the object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name is set as null. This test is important to ensure that the method handles null input as expected.

  Scenario 3: Empty last name input

  Details:  
    TestName: setEmptyLastName.
    Description: The test checks how the method handles an empty string. Since the method does not have a check for empty strings, it is expected to set the last name as an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke setLastName with the empty string.
    Assert: Check if the last name is set as an empty string in the object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name is set as an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the method handles empty strings as expected.

  Scenario 4: Last name input with special characters

  Details:  
    TestName: setLastNameWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: The test checks how the method handles strings with special characters. Since the method does not have a check for special characters, it is expected to set the last name with the special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with special characters.
    Act: Invoke setLastName with the string with special characters.
    Assert: Check if the last name is set with the special characters in the object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the last name is set with the special characters. This test is important to ensure that the method handles strings with special characters as expected.
