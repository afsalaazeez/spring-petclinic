================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The method getLastName() is declared as public which means it can be accessed from any class. This can lead to information disclosure if sensitive information is returned by this method.
Solution: Make the method private if it is not used outside of the class or package private if it is used within the package only.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The method getLastName() is a getter method which returns the value of the private variable 'lastName'. If this variable holds sensitive user data, it can lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed through getter methods. If necessary, use encryption or other protective measures when dealing with such data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: If the method getLastName() is used for debugging purposes and it is accidentally left in the production code, it can provide valuable information to an attacker.
Solution: Ensure that all debug codes are removed from the production code. Use logging mechanisms to capture necessary information during development and disable it in the production environment.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Test to validate the return of last name

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLastName.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getLastName method returns the correct last name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the last name of the object.
  Act: Invoke the getLastName method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned last name matches the set last name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getLastName method is functioning as expected. The expected result is the correct last name as this is what the getLastName method is supposed to return. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the user's last name is correctly retrieved when requested.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the return of last name when it is null

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLastNameWhenNull.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getLastName method returns null when the last name is not set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set the last name of the object.
  Act: Invoke the getLastName method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned last name is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getLastName method returns null when the last name is not set. The expected result is null as this is the expected behavior when the last name is not set. This test is important to ensure that the method handles null values correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the return of last name when it is an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetLastNameWhenEmpty.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the getLastName method returns an empty string when the last name is set as an empty string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the last name of the object as an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getLastName method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned last name is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getLastName method returns an empty string when the last name is set as such. The expected result is an empty string as this is the expected behavior when the last name is set as an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the method handles empty strings correctly.
