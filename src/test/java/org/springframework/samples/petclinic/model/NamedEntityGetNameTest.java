================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
Issue: The current code does not show if it handles XML data, but if it does, it could be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive data from the server, perform SSRF attacks or cause a denial of service.
Solution: To prevent this vulnerability, you should disable DTDs (Document Type Definitions) in your XML parser configuration. For example, if using the javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory, you should call its setFeature method with the appropriate feature string parameters to disable DTDs.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The current code does not show any error handling. In case of any exceptions, the application might expose sensitive information in error messages, which can be exploited by attackers to gather information about the system or application.
Solution: Handle exceptions properly and ensure that no sensitive information is included in the error messages. Instead of returning full exception stack traces to the user, log the exception details and show a generic error message to the user.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If sensitive data is passed in GET requests, the data can be exposed in logs, browser history, and browser cache. While the current code does not show any HTTP request handling, this is a potential risk if it does.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data in GET requests. Instead, use POST requests or secure cookies to pass sensitive data.

  Scenario 1: Test to check if getName method returns the correct name
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsCorrectName
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method returns the correct name that has been previously set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a name for the object.
    Act: Invoke the getName method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned name against the set name.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getName method returns the correct name. The reason behind the expected result is that the getName method should return the exact name that has been set for the object. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the getName method works as expected.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if getName method returns null when no name is set
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsNullWhenNoNameIsSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getName method returns null when no name has been set for the object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set a name for the object.
    Act: Invoke the getName method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned name is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the getName method returns null when no name is set. The reason behind the expected result is that the method should return null when no name has been set for the object. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it tests the behavior of the getName method when no name is set.
