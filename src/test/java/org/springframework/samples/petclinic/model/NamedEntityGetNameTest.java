================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The method getName() does not validate or sanitize the 'name' before returning it. If the 'name' is user input or can be manipulated, it could lead to security vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection.
Solution: Use input validation or sanitization before returning the 'name'. Consider using a library or framework that automatically escapes variables to prevent XSS or SQL Injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method getName() directly exposes object properties. This could lead to sensitive information exposure if the 'name' contains sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure that the 'name' does not contain sensitive data or use an access control mechanism to restrict access to the method getName().

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the 'name' contains private information, the method getName() could expose this information.
Solution: Ensure that the 'name' does not contain private information or use an access control mechanism to restrict access to the method getName().

"""
  Scenario 1: Testing the Normal Operation of getName Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameNormalOperation
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal functionality of the getName method. The target scenario is when the method is called to return the value of the 'name' property.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a name property with a known value.
    Act: Invoke the getName method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getName method accurately returns the value of the 'name' property. This is crucial for the correct operation of any getters, as they must return the actual value of the property they are associated with.

  Scenario 2: Testing the null return of getName Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameNullReturn
    Description: This test is meant to verify the functionality of the getName method when the 'name' property is not initialized. The target scenario is when the method is called and the 'name' property is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not initialize a name property.
    Act: Invoke the getName method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getName method correctly handles the scenario where the 'name' property is not initialized. It should return null in such a case. This is important as it ensures that the method behaves predictably in all scenarios.

  Scenario 3: Testing the getName Method with Empty String Value

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameWithEmptyString
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getName method when the 'name' property is an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a name property with an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getName method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getName method accurately returns the value of the 'name' property, even when it's an empty string. This is important to ensure that the method behaves correctly in all situations.
